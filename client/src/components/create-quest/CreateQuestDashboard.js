            This feature isn't completed yet. And it probably won't be. I was going to make it so that you could easily create new quests of your own. You'd be able to invite different people and track how they're doing on a dashboard. I still might do it at some point, but I would rewrite most of the site and I won't be using the Hammurabbi name for obvious reasons. It was hard enough to finish the site after things ended because I didn't really want to be reminded of you. But I did anyways because I had said I was going to. I hope you liked it.
            
            If you're reading this message, then I just sent you an email. It's not a reward, it's the insane ramblings of yours truly so my apologies.
